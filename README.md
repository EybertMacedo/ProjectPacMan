This C++ project reimagines the classic Pac-Man game to emphasize addiction prevention. Instead of ghosts as obstacles, this version features addictions as antagonists that the player character, Pac-Man, must avoid.

## Introduction

In this unique edition of Pac-Man, the characters symbolize various types of addictions, such as drugs, alcohol, and more. Each addiction is represented by a specific color and exhibits distinctive behavior.

## Gameplay

- **Objective**: The primary objective is to collect all the points without being caught by the addictions. This game centers around promoting healthy habits and activities as a form of prevention.

- **Characters**: The enemies, instead of traditional ghosts, are personified addictions. Each addiction type has a unique color and movement pattern.

- **Power of Knowledge**: Pac-Man can consume books, which increases their power. This power-up allows Pac-Man to confront and overcome addictions temporarily.

- **Maze**: The game unfolds in a maze comprising corridors and corners. Points are scattered throughout the maze, with special items like "power pills" or "fruits" granting temporary points and the ability to confront addictions.

## Scoring and Rewards

The scoring system is linked to the number of points collected and the duration a player stays addiction-free. As players progress through levels, they can earn rewards for their achievements.

## Focus on Self-Care

This version of Pac-Man promotes self-care and self-reflection. It illustrates how healthy choices and coping skills can assist in staying addiction-free.
